# POC_Skeletal_Characterization

**Abstract:**  
In a general context, the genus *Pocillopora* is found in many regions around the world. However, despite the fact that many researchers use these species as models, the identification and description of their skeletons remains poorly understood. Without genetic analysis (using the mtORF marker), it is not possible to reliably identify them during sampling. Therefore, this study was designed to help identify the skeletal characteristics of each species at any stage of life. The study was conducted at a site located on the island of Mo'orea, specifically in the backreef area.

To establish the skeletal characteristics, we used several techniques, including ÂµCT scanning, linear extension (Alizarin staining), bulk density measurements, microscopy, SEM, and synchrotron X-ray.
